# Deep Learning With Keras

The evolution of AI as a field and the increasing number of researchers and practitioners in the field have created a mature and benevolent community. Today, itâ€™s fairly easy to access tools, research papers, datasets, and in fact even infrastructure to practice DL as a field.

### 1. Deep Neural Networks for Supervised Learning: Regression

I have used the Kaggle public data repository for getting datasets for my DL use case. I have used the Rossmann Store sales dataset, which is available at www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales/data. This was a very popular competition hosted a couple of years ago and has a fairly large dataset. You would need to register with Kaggle and accept the competition rules to be able to download the data.
