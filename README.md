# Deep Learning With Keras

The evolution of AI as a field and the increasing number of researchers and practitioners in the field have created a mature and benevolent community. Today, it’s fairly easy to access tools, research papers, datasets, and in fact even infrastructure to practice DL as a field.

1. **Deep Neural Networks for Supervised Learning: Regression**

   I have used the Kaggle public data repository for getting datasets for my DL use case. I have used the Rossmann Store sales dataset, which is available at www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales/data. This was a very popular competition hosted a couple of years ago and has a fairly large dataset. You would need to register with Kaggle and accept the competition rules to be able to download the data. 

   **Problem Statement** 
   
   ​Rossmann is one of the largest drugstore chains in Germany, with operations across Europe. As of 	2018, they have well over 3,900 stores in Europe with an annual turnover of 9 billion euros. My task is to predict the sales for a few identified stores on a given day.

2.  **Deep Neural Networks for Supervised Learning: Classification**

      I have used the dataset provided for the “Red Hat Business Value” competition. This competition was hosted on Kaggle a few years          back,and the dataset is a really good business use case for our study. The archived competition is available at               www.kaggle.com/c/predicting-red-hat-business-value. 
      
      **Problem Statement** 

      The high-level problem statement is mentioned in the competition’s description page. It highlights the problem that deals with   predicting high-value customers for their business based on the operational interaction data and thereby helping the company effectively prioritize resources to generate more business and serve its customers better

 3.  **CNN: Image Classification**

     The dataset i have used is from Kaggle. It was uploaded by Kaggle user rhammel and has 32,000 labeled satellite images of airplanes. By “labeled” I mean that a human being has combed through the images, identified the regions that contain airplanes, and then neatly organized them in an easy to understand format. Itis available at https://www.kaggle.com/rhammell/planesnet/home
      
      **Problem Statement** 

      The aim of this dataset is to help address the difficult task of detecting the location of airplanes in satellite images. Automating this process can be applied to many issues including monitoring airports for activity and traffic patterns, and defense intelligence.Aim is to building a ML pipeline to classify the presence of planes in satellite images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
