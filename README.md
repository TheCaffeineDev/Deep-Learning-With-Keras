# Deep Learning With Keras

The evolution of AI as a field and the increasing number of researchers and practitioners in the field have created a mature and benevolent community. Today, it’s fairly easy to access tools, research papers, datasets, and in fact even infrastructure to practice DL as a field.

1. **Deep Neural Networks for Supervised Learning: Regression**

   I have used the Kaggle public data repository for getting datasets for my DL use case. I have used the Rossmann Store sales dataset, which is available at www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales/data. This was a very popular competition hosted a couple of years ago and has a fairly large dataset. You would need to register with Kaggle and accept the competition rules to be able to download the data. 

   **Problem Statement** 
   
   ​Rossmann is one of the largest drugstore chains in Germany, with operations across Europe. As of 	2018, they have well over 3,900 stores in Europe with an annual turnover of 9 billion euros. My task is to predict the sales for a few identified stores on a given day.

2.  **Deep Neural Networks for Supervised Learning: Classification**

      I have used the dataset provided for the “Red Hat Business Value” competition. This competition was hosted on Kaggle a few years          back,and the dataset is a really good business use case for our study. The archived competition is available at               www.kaggle.com/c/predicting-red-hat-business-value.
